# Device-specific-context-utterance-classification-for-Intelligent-devices


## Introduction
Utterance is any sentence given to an intelligent device. Valid utterances are the sentences for which the device could perform some action. If no action is possible for a sentence, then it is simply an invalid utterance. This project describes a method for utterance classification that does not require manual transcription of training data.
It emphasizes on classifying any given input as a valid or invalid utterance, based on the action coupled with the utterance.


##Dataset
The dataset used for training is created from parsing out the SQuAD dataset and combining it with the SPAADIA dataset.
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
Speech Act Annotated DIAlogues is a small corpus of 35 timetable information and booking interactions between a female call-centre agent and her callers. The sentences are categorized into questions, commands and statements.
