# Device-specific-context-utterance-classification-for-Intelligent-devices


## Introduction
Utterance is any sentence given to an intelligent device. Valid utterances are the sentences for which the device could perform some action. If no action is possible for a sentence, then it is simply an invalid utterance. This project describes a method for utterance classification that does not require manual transcription of training data.
It emphasizes on classifying any given input as a valid or invalid utterance, based on the action coupled with the utterance.
